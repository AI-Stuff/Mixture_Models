Depending on the combo of parameters the model can take a long time to run. 

If you prefer to experiment with the output I already collected you'll need to understand how I saved the data.
The structures are described below.

# to import dict of predictions
# dcts is list of tuples 
#   with tuple = (k, sym, dict)
#     dict keys == values = {a, b, pred_df, cutoff-year}
